After addition of 200 µl methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v) pre-cooled at –40 °C the samples were immediately vortexed for 15 s, sonicated for 15 min at 20 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 19000 x g. The supernatants were transferred to new 2 ml tubes and the remaining pellets subjected to a second extraction using 200 µl methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v). The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge at 30 °C and reconsituted corresponding to a final concentration of 40 mg root material in 200 µl methanol/water 30/70 (v/v) containing 5 µM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as an internal standard.

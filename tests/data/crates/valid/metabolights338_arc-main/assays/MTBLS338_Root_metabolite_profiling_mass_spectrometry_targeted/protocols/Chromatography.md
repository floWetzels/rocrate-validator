<p><strong>LC Chromatography:</strong></p><p>Samples (2.6 μl, full loop injection) were separated at 40 °C on an Acquity UPLC platform (Waters, www.waters.com) equipped with a HSS T3 column (100 × 1.0 mm, particle size 1.8 μm, Waters) applying the following gradient at a flow rate of 150 μl/min: 0–1 min, isocratic 95% A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)), 5% B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)); 1–16 min, linear from 5 to 95% B; 16–18 min, isocratic 95% B; 18–20 min, isocratic 5% B.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>GC Chromatography:</strong></p><p>For GC/MS analysis, 40 µl of the root extract were vacuum-evaporated and subjected to a derivatization with firstly methoxyamine hydrochloride and secondly N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were injected in a splitless manner into a split/splitless inlet of an Agilent 6890N GC and a ZB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 m 95% dimethyl /5% diphenyl polysiloxane film, 10 m integrated guard column, Phenomenex) at 230 °C. The following temperature programme applied: 70 °C/5 min, increasing by 9 °C per min up to 350 °C, 350 °C/5 min, decreasing by 10 °C per min to 330 °C, then 330 °C/5 min.</p>

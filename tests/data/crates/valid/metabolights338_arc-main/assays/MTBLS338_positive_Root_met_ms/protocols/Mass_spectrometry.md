<p>Eluting compounds were detected in positive and negative ionization mode from m/z 80 – 1000 using a MicroTOF–Q I hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). Instrument parameters were defined as follows for the positive mode: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.6 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 L/min, 190°C; capillary, –5000 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 Vpp; funnel 2 RF, 200 Vpp; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV, low mass 55; collision gas, argon; collision energy, 10 eV; collision RF 150 Vpp; transfer time, 70 μs; pre pulse storage, 5 μs; spectra rate, 3 Hz. For the negative ionization mode all parameters were maintained except for the capillary voltage (4000 V).</p><p>All mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode and recalibrated on the basis of lithium formiate cluster ions. EI-MS:</p><p>An Agilent 5975C inert XL MSD Mass Selective Detector was used to detect eluting compounds from m/z 70-600.</p>
